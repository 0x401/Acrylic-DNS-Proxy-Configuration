; DNS服务器支持ipv4和ipv6
; The IP address of your primary DNS  server.  You  can  specify  here  an  IPv4
; address in quad-dotted notation or an IPv6 address in colon-separated  groups.
; 默认使用的8.8.8.8
; Upon installation it points to the primary Google Public DNS server.
;
PrimaryServerAddress=8.8.8.8
;
; The TCP or UDP port your primary DNS server is supposed to  be  listening  to.
; The default value of 53 is the standard port for DNS  resolution.  You  should
; change this value only if you are using a non standard DNS server.
;
PrimaryServerPort=53
;
; The protocol to use with your primary DNS server.
; The currently supported protocols are UDP, TCP and SOCKS5.
;
PrimaryServerProtocol=UDP
;
; The IP address of the proxy server to use to  reach  your primary DNS  server,
; in case you instructed Acrylic to use the  SOCKS5  protocol  in  the  previous
; configuration option. You can specify here  an  IPv4  address  in  quad-dotted
; notation or an IPv6 address in colon-separated groups.

;
; The cluster of domain names the primary DNS server is to resolve.
;
; The affinity mask is a list of semicolon separated values  or  wildcards  that
; allows to restrict which DNS server is going to resolve a particular host
; name.
;
; In the following example only the requests for domain names ending with ".com"
; get forwarded to the primary DNS server:
; 
; PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=*.com
;
; In the following example only the requests for domain names ending with ".com"
; and ".org" get forwarded to the primary DNS server:
;
; PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=*.com;*.org
;
; Negations can be expressed by prepending a caret (^) to the value or wildcard.
;
; In the following example only the requests for domain names  NOT  ending  with
; ".com" or ".org" get forwarded to the primary DNS server (the  last  catch-all
; value is particularly important in this case as, if missing, no request  would
; ever be forwarded to the primary DNS server):
;
; PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=^*.com;^*.org;*
;
;可通过通配符指定哪些域名通过主DNS解析,例如PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=*a.com;^b.com表示以a.com结尾的和以非b.com结尾的域名
;!!!注意，如果想设置非b.com结尾的一定要再加上;*，像这样PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=^b.com;*
;!!!同样，如果不使用此规则，请注释掉此行，如果只=后留空则不会匹配任何域名
;PrimaryServerDomainNameAffinityMask=
;
; A list of semicolon separated values representing DNS query types that  allows
; to restrict which DNS server is going to resolve a particular query type.
;
; In the following example only the requests for A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, SOA and
; SRV query types get forwarded to the primary DNS server:
;
; PrimaryServerQueryTypeAffinityMask=A;AAAA;CNAME;MX;NS;SOA;SRV
;
; The supported query types are:

; THE ACRYLIC DNS CACHING MECHANISM EXPLAINED
; 缓存机制的一些说明
; 首先找AcrylicHosts.txt是否有记录，然后再找AcrylicCache.dat
; When Acrylic receives a DNS request from a client the hosts  cache  (a  static
; cache contained in the AcrylicHosts.txt file) is searched  first.  If  nothing
; is found in it the request is subsequently searched in the  address  cache  (a
; dynamic cache contained in the AcrylicCache.dat file).  At  this  point  three
; things may happen:
; 如果缓存里都没有或者查询超时的话就会通过之前设置的所有DNS服务器同时查询,取最快返回的那个结果
; Case 1:
;
; The request is not found in the address cache or  its  corresponding  response
; is older than AddressCacheScavengingTime minutes: In this  case  the  original
; request is forwarded to all of the configured DNS servers simultaneously.  The
; response to the client is delayed until the first one  of the  configured  DNS
; servers comes out with a valid response (all the others will be discarded).
; 如果缓存无结果（第一次查询）或者间隔查询时间大于AddressCacheScavengingTime，查询并缓存
; Case 2:
;
; The request is found in the address cache and its  corresponding  response  is
; older  than  AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime   minutes   but   not   older   than
; AddressCacheScavengingTime minutes: In this case the response  to  the  client
; is sent immediately from the address cache and the original  request  is  also
; forwarded to all of the configured DNS servers like in the previous case.  The
; first response coming from one of the configured DNS servers will be  used  to
; silently update the address cache (all the others will be discarded).
; 如果缓存有结果并且间隔查询时间介于AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime和AddressCacheScavengingTime之间，则返回缓存中的结果，然后再查询更新缓存
; Case 3:
;
; The request is found in the address cache and its  corresponding  response  is
; younger than AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime minutes: In this case  the  response
; to the client is sent immediately  from  the  address  cache  and  no  network
; activity with the configured DNS servers will occur.
; 如果缓存有结果半夜间隔查询时间小于AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime，则返回缓存中的结果，不在查询和更新缓存
; Note: Negative responses from the DNS servers can be cached with  a  different
; expiration time (usually much smaller) than positive ones by setting the value
; of the AddressCacheNegativeTime parameter.
; 注意：查询的如果是“请求超时”这些没有有效的ip的结果同样也会被缓存，过期时间由AddressCacheNegativeTime控制,
;      例如设置为10，则10分钟内都会返回“请求超时”，超过10分钟才会重新查询
; Simply using Acrylic with default parameters should give a lot of boost to the
; performance of your DNS queries but to get the best out of it you may have  to
; tune it to your specific needs:
;
; If you are concerned with the cache not being enough up to date (e.g. you  are
; using Acrylic on a LAN with addresses given by a DHCP  server  using  a  short
; lease)  use  a  lower  value  for  the  AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime  and  the
; AddressCacheNegativeTime parameters:
;
; AddressCacheNegativeTime=10
; AddressCacheScavengingTime=600
; AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=60
;
; If your DNS servers are particularly unreliable and you want to  minimize  the
; disruption to your work should they become unresponsive use a higher value for
; the AddressCacheScavengingTime and the AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime:
;
; AddressCacheNegativeTime=10
; AddressCacheScavengingTime=57600
; AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=1440
;
; And now about the caching parameters:
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a negative response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheNegativeTime=10
;
; The time to live (in minutes) of a positive response in the address cache.
;
AddressCacheScavengingTime=28800
;
; The time (in minutes) elapsed which an item  in  the  address  cache  must  be
; silently updated should a request occur.
;
AddressCacheSilentUpdateTime=1440
;
; You can disable the address cache by  choosing  Yes  instead  of  No.  If  you
; do that Acrylic will work as a forwarding-only DNS proxy.
; 关闭缓存功能
AddressCacheDisabled=No
;
; The local IPv4 address to which Acrylic binds.  A value of  0.0.0.0  indicates
; that Acrylic should bind to all available addresses and as  such  it  will  be
; able to receive DNS requests coming from all of  your  network  interfaces.  A
; value corresponding to the IPv4 address of one  of  them  instead  will  allow
; Acrylic to receive DNS requests only from that specific network  interface. An
; empty value instead indicates that no binding should occur on IPv4.
;
LocalIPv4BindingAddress=0.0.0.0
;
; The local UDPv4 port to which Acrylic binds. The default value of  53  is  the
; standard port for DNS resolution. You should change this  value  only  if  you
; are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalIPv4BindingPort=53
;
; The local IPv6 address to which Acrylic  binds.  A  value  of  0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
; indicates that Acrylic should  bind  to  all  available  addresses.  An  empty
; value instead indicates that no binding should occur on IPv6.
;
LocalIPv6BindingAddress=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
;
; The local UDPv6 port to which Acrylic binds. The default value of  53  is  the
; standard port for DNS resolution. You should change this  value  only  if  you
; are using a non standard DNS client.
;
LocalIPv6BindingPort=53
;
; On Windows versions prior to Windows Vista or Windows  Server  2008  the  IPv6
; protocol is usually not installed by default. For  Windows  2000  there  is  a
; Microsoft IPv6 Technology Preview package available  for  download  while  for
; Windows XP the IPv6 protocol must be added to the list  of  available  network
; protocols in your network connection Properties window.
;
; If you want to enable local IPv6 binding for Acrylic on Windows versions prior
; to Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 you can choose Yes below after  having
; installed all the necessary prerequisites.
;
LocalIPv6BindingEnabledOnWindowsVersionsPriorToWindowsVistaOrWindowsServer2008=No
;
; The time to live (in seconds) set for DNS responses generated by Acrylic (e.g.
; the ones generated from mappings contained in the Acrylic HOSTS file).
;
GeneratedResponseTimeToLive=60
;
; The file name of the hit log into which every incoming  DNS  request  seen  by
; Acrylic gets logged. You can specify here an absolute or a relative  path  and
; a sort of daily log rotation can be achieved by including the %DATE%  template
; within the file name. Here is the list of all supported templates:
;
; %DATE%
; The current date in YYYYMMDD format.
;
; %TEMP%
; The current value of the TEMP environment variable.
;
; %APPDATA%
; The current value of the APPDATA environment variable.
;
; %LOCALAPPDATA%
; The current value of the LOCALAPPDATA environment variable.
;
; Examples:
; 设置域名解析日志文件保存的地址
; HitLogFileName=HitLog.%DATE%.txt
; HitLogFileName=%TEMP%\AcrylicDNSProxyHitLog.%DATE%.txt
;
; In the hit log, along with the packet timestamp, client  address  and  request
; description there's a treatment field code (how Acrylic treated it):
; 域名解析的几种状态
; B -> Explicitly blocked
; H -> Resolved from the hosts cache
; C -> Resolved from the address cache
; F -> Forwarded to the configured DNS servers
; R -> Received from one of the configured DNS servers
; U -> Silent update from one of the configured DNS servers
; 设置域名解析日志文件保存的地址
HitLogFileName=
;
; The filter which controls what gets logged into the hit log and  what  not.  A
; valid filter is whatever combination of packet types (for  their  meaning  see
; the previous note) specified in any order.
; 设置哪几种状态被记录
HitLogFileWhat=BHCFRU
;
; You can force Acrylic to write the hit log  in  the  old  (0.9.24)  format  by
; uncommenting the following line. The new  format  has  more  informations  but
; you may want to use the old one for compatibility  with  an  already  existing
; log analyzer.
; 强制使用旧版本(0.9.24)的日志文件格式
; HitLogFileMode=Legacy
;
; The file name of the stats log into which  Acrylic  saves  informations  about
; the performance of your DNS servers and some statistical data about  the  fate
; of your DNS requests. You can specify here an absolute or a relative path. All
; these templates are also supported within the file name:
;
; %TEMP%
; The current value of the TEMP environment variable.
;
; %APPDATA%
; The current value of the APPDATA environment variable.
;
; %LOCALAPPDATA%
; The current value of the LOCALAPPDATA environment variable.
;
; Examples:
;
; StatsLogFileName=StatsLog.txt
; StatsLogFileName=%TEMP%\AcrylicDNSProxyStatsLog.txt
; 设置软件状态日志文件保存的地址

;
; ENABLING THE ACRYLIC HTTP SERVER
;
; The Acrylic HTTP server is primarily used to provide some default  content  to
; your browser when a domain name is resolved through the Acrylic hosts file  as
; localhost.
;
; When enabled the default behaviour of Acrylic, for  security  reasons,  is  to
; handle only requests coming from localhost.
;
; If  you  want  to  change  that   it   is   possible   to   specify   in   the
; AllowedAddressesSection a list of IP addresses or IP subnets  from  which  can
; come requests that Acrylic is allowed to handle. For more informations  please
; refer to the comments relative to the AllowedAddressesSection below.
;
; And now about the Acrylic HTTP server parameters:
;
; The local IPv4 address to which the Acrylic HTTP  server  binds.  A  value  of
; 0.0.0.0 indicates that it should bind to all available addresses and  as  such
; it will be able to receive HTTP requests  coming  from  all  of  your  network
; interfaces. A value corresponding to the IPv4 address of one of  your  network
; interface instead will allow Acrylic to receive HTTP requests only  from  that
; specific network interface. An empty value instead indicates that  no  binding
; should occur on IPv4.
;
HttpServerBindingAddress=
;
; The local TCPv4 port to which Acrylic HTTP server binds. The default value  of
; 80 is the standard port for HTTP servers.
;
HttpServerBindingPort=80
;
; ALLOWING REQUESTS FROM OTHER COMPUTERS
;
; Although for security reasons the default behaviour of Acrylic is to refuse to
; handle requests coming from other computers it is possible to specify  in  the
; AllowedAddressesSection a list of IP addresses or IP subnets  from  which  can
; come requests that Acrylic is  allowed  to  handle.  You  have  to  specify  a
; different key name for each entry, like in the following example:
;
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=192.168.45.254        -- A single IP address
; IP2=192.168.44.100        -- Another single IP address
; IP3=192.168.100.*         -- All addresses starting with 192.168.100
; IP4=172.16.*              -- All addresses starting with 172.16
;
; For performance reasons keep the number of addresses listed in this section as
; low as possible (you should try to specify subnets instead of large  lists  of
; IP addresses whenever possible).
;
; Note: Wildcards (like 192.168.100.*) are  allowed.  Although  not  recommended
; for security reasons you can allow Acrylic to handle requests coming from  any
; IP address, like in the following example:
; 
; [AllowedAddressesSection]
; IP1=*
; 设置局域网內那些IP可把本机作为DNS服务器
[AllowedAddressesSection]
;
; The CacheExceptionsSection section below may contain a list of names for which
; caching does not occur (DNS requests for them are directly  forwarded  to  the
; DNS servers). This may be useful if you have a small subset  of  IP  addresses
; that change rapidly but you don't want to loose the  performance  improvements
; of caching for all the other addresses.
;
; Example:
; 设置不缓存的域名
; [CacheExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=somemachine.mydomain.local
; NAME2=*.microsoft.com
;
; Note: Wildcards (like *.microsoft.com) are allowed.
;
[CacheExceptionsSection]
;
; The WhiteExceptionsSection section below may contain a list of  names  outside
; of which DNS requests are resolved by Acrylic as "localhost". If  the  section
; is empty Acrylic behaves normally by  trying  to  resolve  every  DNS  request
; through all its  strategies (hosts  cache, address  cache,  forward).  If  the
; section contains at least an item instead Acrylic behaves as in some  sort  of
; parental control mode by resolving  automatically  as  "localhost"  every  DNS
; request for hosts which are not present in the list.
;
; Example:
; 设置直接作为localhost解析的域名
; [WhiteExceptionsSection]
; NAME1=mayakron.altervista.org
; NAME2=*.wikipedia.org
;
; Note: Wildcards (like *.wikipedia.org) are allowed.
;
